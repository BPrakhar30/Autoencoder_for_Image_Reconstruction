# Autoencoder for Image Reconstruction 

## Overview
In this project, we explore the use of autoencoders for image reconstruction. The focus is on understanding and implementing autoencoders, a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient data codings in an unsupervised manner.

## Key Concepts
- **Autoencoder Architecture**: Comprises an encoder to compress the input and a decoder to reconstruct the input from the compressed code.
- **Training and Testing**: The model is trained with a dataset and tested to evaluate its reconstruction accuracy.
- **Loss Function**: Utilizes a specific loss function to measure the difference between the original and reconstructed images.

## Implementation Details
- **Dataset**: Uses a predefined dataset for training and testing.
- **Neural Network Model**: Implemented using PyTorch.
- **Code Snippets**: Includes code for data loading, model building, training, and testing.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates the effectiveness of autoencoders in image reconstruction, highlighting the potential of neural networks in image processing and unsupervised learning tasks.
